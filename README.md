# by_iLy_Audit_Log_Viewer
A read-only audit log viewer for Internet Computer canisters. Displays a paginated table of system events -- timestamp, principal, action, entity -- with role-based access control that restricts the view to admin users.  Extracted from a production enterprise portfolio management platform. The component is fully functional as a standalone module.
